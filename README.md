# Wordle-Clone
Clone of the infamous "Wordle" crosswords puzzle by The New York Times.

This was a university project for an advanced programming course and was a three-person team effort.

I was personally responsible for the logic of the keyboard mode while my teammates were responsible for the drag-and-drop mode and all the UI elements.

Debugging was a team effort.
